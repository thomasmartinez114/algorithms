// Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Sum All Primes

// Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.

// A prime number is defined as a number greater than one and having only two divisors, one and itself.For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by one and two.

// The provided number may not be a prime.

// Remember to use Read - Search - Ask if you get stuck.Try to pair program.Write your own code.
