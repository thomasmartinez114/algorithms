// Given an array of integers, calculate the fractions of its elements that are positive, negative, and are zeros.Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line.

// Note: This challenge introduces precision problems.The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to  are acceptable.

// For example, given the array  there are  elements, two positive, two negative and one zero.Their ratios would be, 2/5 positives, 2/5 negatives, 1/5 zeros and. It should be printed as:
// 0.400000
// 0.400000
// 0.200000

// print each on their own line rounded to 6th place
// arr is the array of intergers
