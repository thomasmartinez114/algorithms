// Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers

// Given a positive integer num, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to num.

// The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers.The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8.

// For example, sumFibs(10)should return 10because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to 10are 1, 1, 3, and 5.
